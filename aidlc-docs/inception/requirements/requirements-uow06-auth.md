# Requirements — User Authentication & Authorization Construction (UOW-06)

## Intent Analysis

- **User request**: "ユーザー認証・認可の Construction を開始する" — extend the auth
  domain of `utopia` (Rust/Axum, Firefly-III partial-compatible household finance API).
- **Request type**: Enhancement / New unit of work (UOW-06 candidate) extending the
  existing auth domain.
- **Scope estimate**: Multiple components (auth core, middleware, cache, config,
  docker topology, tests).
- **Complexity estimate**: Moderate (external IdP delegation lowers credential-handling
  risk, but JWT validation, user sync, and Security Baseline compliance add surface).

### Decisions (from `auth-construction-questions.md`)

| Q | Answer | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 Primary scope | **C** | Adopt **GoTrue** as external authorization server (IdP). It owns registration, password login, OAuth/social, and issues access + refresh JWTs. utopia becomes a resource server validating GoTrue-issued JWTs. |
| Q2 Relation to existing token model | **C (Layered)** | GoTrue JWTs are a separate credential type mapping to the existing `Principal`, coexisting with PAT + bootstrap key during migration. |
| Q3 Firefly-III compatibility | **A (Hard constraint)** | Data endpoints keep `FireflySingleEnvelope` / `FireflyErrorResponse`. utopia adds no own auth endpoints — only validates Bearer JWTs. |
| Q4 Requirements depth | **A (Standard)** | Bounded scope; Security Baseline (SEC-001..007) remains blocking. |

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-01 (External IdP delegation)**: utopia SHALL NOT issue or store user
  credentials. Authentication is delegated to GoTrue.
- **FR-02 (JWT validation)**: For requests carrying a GoTrue-issued Bearer JWT,
  utopia SHALL validate:
  - signature (via GoTrue JWKS, cached locally),
  - `exp` (expiration),
  - `aud` (audience — must match configured value),
  - `iss` (issuer — must match configured GoTrue issuer URL).
- **FR-03 (Principal mapping)**: On successful validation, utopia SHALL build a
  `Principal` from JWT claims (`sub`, `email`, `role`/`app_metadata`).
- **FR-04 (User sync / JIT provisioning)**: On first authenticated request for an
  unknown `sub`, utopia SHALL create/link a local user record keyed by the GoTrue
  `sub` (external ID). Existing `users` table is extended with an external subject
  column; no password columns are required for GoTrue-sourced users.
- **FR-05 (Layered coexistence)**: Existing PAT + bootstrap-key flows SHALL remain
  functional and unchanged. Both credential types resolve to the same `Principal`.
- **FR-06 (Firefly compatibility)**: All data endpoints SHALL keep existing
  Firefly-compatible JSON contracts. No new auth endpoints are added to utopia;
  clients obtain tokens directly from GoTrue.
- **FR-07 (JWKS caching)**: utopia SHALL cache GoTrue JWKS (public keys) with a
  bounded TTL to avoid per-request network calls to GoTrue.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-SEC-01 (Token validation, SEC-08)**: JWT validation SHALL occur
  server-side on every request; invalid/expired/aud/iss-mismatched tokens SHALL be
  rejected with `401` + `FireflyErrorResponse`.
- **NFR-SEC-02 (Constant-time comparison)**: Any local claim/signature comparison
  SHALL use constant-time primitives (consistent with existing `subtle` usage).
- **NFR-SEC-03 (Audit logging, SEC-03/SEC-08)**: Authentication failures,
  authorization denials, and JIT provisioning events SHALL be written to the
  existing audit logger (`audit_logger.rs`) with timestamp, request ID, and reason
  — no secrets/PII in logs.
- **NFR-SEC-04 (Rate limiting, SEC-11)**: Public-facing endpoints (including the
  existing bootstrap token route) SHALL retain rate limiting
  (`rate_limiter.rs`). GoTrue itself rate-limits its own login endpoints.
- **NFR-SEC-05 (CORS, SEC-08)**: CORS on authenticated endpoints SHALL be
  restricted to explicitly allowed origins (no wildcard on authenticated routes).
- **NFR-SEC-06 (No hardcoded secrets, SEC-12)**: GoTrue JWKS URL, `aud`, `iss`,
  and any shared secrets SHALL be supplied via environment/config
  (`AppConfig`), never hardcoded.
- **NFR-REL-01 (Availability)**: JWKS caching SHALL ensure utopia can validate
  tokens without a synchronous call to GoTrue per request (resilience to GoTrue
  brief outages within cache TTL).
- **NFR-OBS-01 (Metrics, SEC-14)**: JWT validation outcomes (success/failure
  reason) SHALL be emitted via the existing Prometheus metrics (`metrics.rs`).
- **NFR-TST-01 (Property-Based Testing, Partial extension)**: Pure functions —
  notably claim→`Principal` mapping and JWT claim validation logic — SHALL have
  property-based tests.
- **NFR-TST-02 (Integration testing)**: Integration tests SHALL cover the JWT
  validation path (GoTrue-emitted token, or a test JWT signed with a known key /
  mock JWKS) against the running app + PostgreSQL (testcontainers).

## Architectural Considerations

- **Resource server pattern**: utopia = OAuth2 Resource Server; GoTrue = Authorization
  Server. Clients (Waterfly-iii) obtain JWTs from GoTrue, send `Bearer` to utopia.
- **Minimal change surface**: Reuse existing `auth_middleware`, `Principal`,
  `FireflyErrorResponse`. Introduce a JWT validator adapter alongside the existing
  PAT validator; `TokenCache` is repurposed/extended for JWKS caching.
- **Docker topology**: `docker/docker-compose.yml` gains a GoTrue service
  (or Supabase Auth) with PostgreSQL; utopia's `AppConfig` gains GoTrue JWKS/aud/iss
  settings.
- **Migration**: `0005_*` migration adds external subject column to `users` (and any
  index needed for JIT lookup).

## Security Baseline Compliance Summary (Extension ENABLED — blocking)

| Rule | Status | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 Encryption at rest/transit | N/A (no new store; uses existing PG/TLS) | Reuses existing encrypted PostgreSQL + TLS |
| SEC-02 Network intermediary logging | N/A (no new LB/API GW introduced) | Existing Caddy/Prometheus topology unchanged |
| SEC-03 App-level logging | Compliant | Reuses `audit_logger.rs` + tracing JSON subscriber |
| SEC-04 HTTP security headers | N/A (utopia serves JSON API, not HTML) | No HTML-serving endpoints |
| SEC-05 Input validation | Compliant | JWT parsed/validated before use; existing validators retained |
| SEC-06 Least-privilege | Compliant | GoTrue-scoped config; no wildcard grants introduced |
| SEC-07 Restrictive network | N/A (no new network rules in this unit) | Docker network scoped as before |
| SEC-08 App-level access control | **Compliant (key constraint)** | Server-side JWT validation every request; CORS restricted; deny-by-default |
| SEC-09 Hardening | Compliant | No default creds; generic error responses retained |
| SEC-10 Supply chain | Compliant | New deps pinned in `Cargo.toml` lockfile |
| SEC-11 Secure design | **Compliant (key constraint)** | Auth logic isolated in `core/auth`; rate limiting retained; misuse (bad token) handled |
| SEC-12 Auth & credential mgmt | Compliant (delegated) | Credential storage/MFA/lockout owned by GoTrue; utopia validates only |
| SEC-13 Integrity | Compliant | JWT signature verified via JWKS; no unsafe deserialization |
| SEC-14 Alerting/monitoring | Compliant | Validation metrics via existing Prometheus |

No blocking findings. Security Baseline satisfied for the utopia-side scope of UOW-06.
